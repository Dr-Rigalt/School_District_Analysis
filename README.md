# School_District_Analysis
Insights and performance atterns to help strategic decisions

## Project Overview ðŸ“‹

The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once youâ€™ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Resources ðŸ”§

* Data Source: schools_complete.csv & students_complete.csv
* Softaware: Anaconda Navigator 2.1.0 & Jupiter Notebook 6.4.3

## Results

* How is the district summary affected?
* How is the school summary affected?
* How does replacing the ninth gradersâ€™ math and reading scores affect Thomas High Schoolâ€™s performance relative to the other schools?
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
* Math and reading scores by grade
* Scores by school spending
* Scores by school size
* Scores by school type

## Summary & Results ðŸ“„

We initially started with data from 39,170 students, but we were asked to replace the math and reading scores for 9th garde students from Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. And then, repeat the school district analysis.Then 38,709 records were kept.

### After that considerarion we got the following metrics

### Thomas High School ranks 2nd based on the overall percentage of passing students.

Base on math and reading scores by grade we found Bailey High School in the first place

### Top five schools:

Thomas High School ranks 2nd based on the overall percentage of passing students.
